There are two Jupyter notebooks in the folder:

"Data_Cleaning_and_Exploratory_Data_Analysis" which begins with the initial dataset "data_set_project_andHealth20232024" cleans it, performs exploratory analysis, and ultimately saves the cleaned dataset as "CleanDataset".

"Clustering_and_Statistical_Analysis" which utilizes the "CleanDataset" for clustering and statistical analysis.

Both datasets are already available within the folder, and the two notebooks can be run independently.
