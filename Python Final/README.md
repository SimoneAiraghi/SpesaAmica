# üêç Python Analysis

This folder contains two Jupyter notebooks:

- **`Data_Cleaning_and_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`**  
  Starts from the initial dataset **`data_set_project_andHealth20232024`**, performs data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and saves the processed output as **`CleanDataset`**.

- **`Clustering_and_Statistical_Analysis.ipynb`**  
  Uses the **`CleanDataset`** to perform clustering and statistical analysis.

Both datasets are already included in the folder, and the notebooks can be executed independently.
